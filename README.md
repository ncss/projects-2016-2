Workflow for the project.

Each feature will be created in a different branch. (NOTE: Ensure the feature does not already contain a branch. Meaningful branch names are very important.) You may commit as many time as you please. It is extremely important that you write specific and detailed commit messages. 

When your feature is working, you can merge the 'dev' branch into your branch. Steps include:
•Write your name on the Merge Queue 
•Switch to the dev branch
•Sync the dev branch
•Call over a tutor 
•Tutor will assist in merging dev into your feature
•Test the build in your feature branch to show the tutor that it works
•Tutor will merge feature into dev 

Dev will be merged into master by tutors. (NOTE: NEVER merge into master. Master is a "magical land in which you are not allowed to enter"*.)
